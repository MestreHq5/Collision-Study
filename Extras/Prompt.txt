Hi ChatGPT,

I’m working on a collision‑analysis project for my university’s Department of Mechanics. The goal is to record a hockey‑table experiment, detect each disk, track its rotation via an off‑center circular mark (blue or green), and analyze collisions.

---

**Project goal**

* Record a tabletop hockey experiment
* Detect and segment each puck in video frames
* Track each puck’s rotation via an off‑center colored marker (blue or green)
* Compute collision events, angles, speeds, and restitution coefficients

**Code & pipeline so far**

1. **`Pre_process.py`**

   * `segment_disks(frame)`: background subtraction → threshold → opening → circle‐fitting → returns list of puck centers & radii
   * `detect_marker_center(roi, center, radius)`: crop disk ROI → HSV threshold for blue/green → morphological filtering → blob detection → marker center
2. **`main.py`**

   * Captures video frames → updates background model → calls segmentation + marker detection → logs results to CSV → runs unit tests
3. **Hardware Prep**

   * Plan to paint pucks matte‑black for higher contrast

**Recent tweaks & results**

* **Expanded green HSV range** from `[50,100,100]–[70,255,255]` to `[40,80,80]–[90,255,255]`
  → This alone restored reliable green‑mark recall under motion blur.
* **PyTest skeleton** drafted in `tests/test_preprocess.py` to compare detected centers (puck & marker) against a ground‑truth CSV (`data/ground_truth.csv`) and frame images (`data/frames/frame_####.png`).

**Remaining needs**

1. **Test integration**

   * Wire the PyTest fixture up to your real CSV and image folder
   * Write parameterized tests for:

     * Marker detection accuracy (tolerance in pixels)
     * Disk segmentation (count, centers & radii)
     * Edge cases (missing/occluded markers, overlapping pucks)
2. **Detection refinements**

   * **Pre‑smoothing** (Gaussian or bilateral) before HSV thresholding
   * **Adaptive HSV thresholds** (track running mean±std of marker color per puck)
   * **Scaled morphology** (kernel size ∝ disk radius + extra closing/dilation)
   * (Optional) deblurring filters or CIE Lab thresholding
3. **Automated parameter tuning**

   * Script to sweep HSV bounds & kernel sizes, record detection rates, visualize heatmap
4. **CI & robustness**

   * Integrate tests into GitHub Actions or similar
   * Add performance metrics (recall, precision) and regression alerts
5. **Future GUI & analysis**

   * (Later) Build a PySide6 or Dash front‑end for real‑time tracking, playback & collision summaries

**Ask:**
Guide me through:

* Completing the pytest setup (fixtures, folder paths, helper functions)
* Writing concrete test cases for both segmentation and marker detection
* Adding any needed helper utilities (e.g. ROI cropping, error metrics)
* Structuring a CI pipeline to run these tests on every commit

Let’s start by fleshing out the `tests/test_preprocess.py` file so it actually loads my CSV/images and asserts both puck and marker accuracy.


📌 Project Context (Hockey Table Collision Analysis)

You’re working on a hockey-table collision analysis pipeline:

main.py → records detections (disk center & colored marker) into disk_tracks.csv.

detect_collisions_simple.py → finds collision frames from motion changes → saves collisions_simple.csv.

compute_velocities_min8.py → computes linear & angular velocities for each disk before and after collisions → saves velocities_summary.csv.

✅ Already done

Tracking working (green disk = ID 0, blue = ID 1).

Collision detection script generates collisions_simple.csv.

Velocity computation simplified:

Only radian angular velocity (no degrees).

Uses all available frames before/after each collision (bounded by neighbor collisions or edges).

Output = 8 values total per collision (per disk):

linear_before_mm_s, linear_after_mm_s

angular_before_rad_s, angular_after_rad_s

❓ Pending / To decide

Whether to add extra derived quantities (e.g. coefficient of restitution).

Whether to merge collision_frames directly into velocity outputs for easier referencing.

Whether to add robustness filters (radius band check for marker validity).

Whether to visualize velocity evolution over time (not just before/after).
